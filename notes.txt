MSVC compiler is stuck with OpenMP version 2.0, and unfortunately for you, reduction(max:) was only introduced with version 3.1 of the OpenMP C/C++ standard (that was in September 2011)

So you can either change of compiler, or doing the reduction operation the old way with some private variables and a final reduction with critical accumulations

Complicated reductions in OMP/C++ are very compiler dependent. You may need to try more than one compiler, and not the one in Visual Studio. 2. The "declare reduction" is not the most elegant solution: better to define operator+ on maps. You may need to write a minimal class around std::map. 3. I don't share @JérômeRichard 's concern about bandwidth since there are far fewer primes than ints. –
